		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>
	<h4>What is this?</h4>
	<p>&raquo;Prez&laquo; is a simple password prompter.</p>
	
	<h4>Why should I use one?</h4>
	<p>Regular Passwords are not safe. All passwords that contain words which can be found in a dictionary are vulnerable to getting attacked. 
	The same applies to passwords that are too short. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi&amp;s=articles">article</a> to find 
	out how long your password would stand against brute force attacks. 
	Also take into account that computing power <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">doubles every two years</a> and check out the 
	<a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">500 most common passwords</a>.<br/>
	If you still prefer to choose these passwords because they are easy to remember Prez has the answer. 
	It lets you choose an "easy to remember"-password and gives you a "hard to guess"-password in return.</p>

	<h4>How does it work?</h4>
	<p>When a user enters a weak password that hasn't been used before, a set of strong passwords is generated at random. 
	These passwords are then stored in a database (encrypted of course) and are linked to the provided weak password. 
	This means you can always retrieve your strong passwords with the appropriate weak password.<br/>
	Technically it's the same that happens when you enter a weak password which has been used by someone else before you. 
	In that case you would use the same password, without knowing if from each other (which is why it doesn't matter).<br/>
	You might find it confusing that the passwords are available to anyone, but out of context they are usually worthless.
	</p>

	<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
	<p>The honest is: I don't know. I am not a security expert, and it certainly has it's vulnerabilities. 
	However, since this is app is rather unknown I consider it safe enough for my purposes. You decide for yourself.<br/> 
	The data is transmitted with 128-bit encryption via TLS 1.0 and the app runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google Appengine</a>,
	providing high uptime.<br/>
	If you want a more sophisticated an corporate-backed solution you may try <a href="https://dashboard.usablelogin.net/">Useable Login</a>.
	</p>

	<h4>Why are there so many passwords?</h4>
	<p>An even bigger problem that's due to the same reasons is <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">password reuse</a>. In order to address this issue,
	multiple strong passwords are given. They are all linked to the same weak password and come in different colors so thy are easier to remember.
