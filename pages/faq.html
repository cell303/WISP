		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>
	<h4>What is this?</h4>
	<p class="text">&raquo;WISP&laquo; is a simple password prompter.</p>
	
	<h4>Why should I use one?</h4>
	<p class="text">Passwords are not safe. All passwords that contain words which can be found in a dictionary are vulnerable to attack.
	The same applies to passwords that are too short. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi&amp;s=articles">article</a> to find 
	out how long your password would stand against brute force attacks. Also take into account that computing power 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">doubles every two years</a>.
	Also check out the <a href="http://www.whatsmypass.com/the-top-500-worst-passwords-of-all-time">500 most common passwords</a>.<br/>
	Still you like choose these passwords because they are easy to remember, ignoring the risk.
	&raquo;WISP&laquo; lets you choose an "easy to remember"-password and gives you a "hard to guess"-password in return.<br/></p>

	<h4>How does it work?</h4>
	<p class="text">
	When a user enters a &raquo;weak password&laquo; that hasn't been used before, a set of &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; is generated at random.<br/>
	The passwords are then stored in a database (encrypted of course) and are linked to the provided &raquo;weak password&laquo;. 
	This means you can always retrieve your &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; with the appropriate &raquo;weak password&laquo;.<br/>
	Technically thats the same what happens when you enter a weak password that has been used by someone else before you. 
	In that case you would use the same passwords, without knowing of each other. (Which is why it doesn't matter)<br/>
	You might find it confusing that the passwords are available to anyone, but out of context they are usually worthless.
	</p>

	<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
	<p class="text">The honest answer would be: I don't know. I am not a security expert, and it probably has it's vulnerabilities. 
	However, since this is app is rather unknown I think it's safe enough for my purposes. You decide for yourself.<br/>
	The data itself is transmitted with 128-bit encryption via TLS 1.0 and the app runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google Appengine</a>, 
	providing high uptime.<br/>
	If you want a more sophisticated an corporate-backed solution you may try <a href="https://dashboard.usablelogin.net/">Useable Login</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Why are there so many passwords?</h4>
	<p class="text">A even bigger problem that comes for the same reasons is <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">password reuse</a>. In order to address this issue,
	multiple &raquo;strong passwords&laquo; are given. They are all linked to the same
	&raquo;weak password&laquo; and come in different colors so that you can remember them easier.<br/>
